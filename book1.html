    <p id="chap1"><b>1. No One’s Crazy</b>
    <pre>
            Let me tell you about a problem. It might make you feel better about what
                    you do with your money, and less judgmental about what other people do
                    with theirs.
                    People do some crazy things with money. But no one is crazy.
                    Here’s the thing: People from different generations, raised by different
                    parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different
                    parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job
                    markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very
                    different lessons.
                    Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And
                    what you’ve experienced is more compelling than what you learn secondhand. So all of us—you, me, everyone—go through life anchored to a set of
                    views about how money works that vary wildly from person to person. What
                    seems crazy to you might make sense to me.
                    The person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk and reward in ways the
                    child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom if he tried.
                    The person who grew up when inflation was high experienced something the
                    person who grew up with stable prices never had to.
                    The stock broker who lost everything during the Great Depression
                    experienced something the tech worker basking in the glory of the late 1990s
                    can’t imagine.
                    The Australian who hasn’t seen a recession in 30 years has experienced
                    something no American ever has.
                    On and on. The list of experiences is endless.
                    You know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life
                    with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one
                    of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve

    <p id="chap2"><b>2. Luck & Risk    </b>
        <pre>
                                Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life
                    is guided by forces other than individual effort.
                    NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to
                    remember when judging success—both your own and others’: “Nothing is as
                    good or as bad as it seems.”
                    Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a
                    computer.
                    The story of how Lakeside School, just outside Seattle, even got a computer
                    is remarkable.
                    Bill Dougall was a World War II navy pilot turned high school math and
                    science teacher. “He believed that book study wasn’t enough without realworld experience. He also realized that we’d need to know something about
                    computers when we got to college,” recalled late Microsoft co-founder Paul
                    Allen.
                    In 1968 Dougall petitioned the Lakeside School Mothers’ Club to use the
                    proceeds from its annual rummage sale—about $3,000—to lease a Teletype
                    Model 30 computer hooked up to the General Electric mainframe terminal for
                    computer time-sharing. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in
                    1965,” Gates later said. “Someone was pretty forwardlooking.” Most
                    university graduate schools did not have a computer anywhere near as
                    advanced as Bill Gates had access to in eighth grade. And he couldn’t get
                    enough of it.
                    Gates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul Allen. Allen was
                    also obsessed with the school’s computer, and the two hit it off.

        <p id="chap3"><b>3. Never Enough </b>
            <pre>
                John Bogle, the Vanguard founder who passed away in 2019, once told a
                story about money that highlights something we don’t think about enough:
                At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his
                pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more
                money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel
                Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something
                he will never have … enough.”
                Enough. I was stunned by the simple eloquence of that word—stunned for
                two reasons: first, because I have been given so much in my own life and,
                second, because Joseph Heller couldn’t have been more accurate.
                For a critical element of our society, including many of the wealthiest and
                most powerful among us, there seems to be no limit today on what enough
                entails.
                It’s so smart, and so powerful.
                Let me offer two examples of the dangers of not having enough, and what
                they can teach us.
                Rajat Gupta was born in Kolkata and orphaned as a teenager. People talk
                about the privileged few who begin life on third base. Gupta couldn’t even
                see the baseball stadium.
                What he went on to achieve from those beginnings was simply phenomenal.
                By his mid 40s Gupta was CEO of McKinsey, the world’s most prestigious
                consulting firm. He retired in 2007 to take on roles with the United Nations
                and the World Economic Forum. He partnered on philanthropic work wit

            <p id="chap4"><b>4. Confounding Compounding       </b>
                <pre>
                    Lessons from one field can often teach us something important about
                    unrelated fields. Take the billion-year history of ice ages, and what they teach
                    us about growing your money.
                    Our scientific knowledge of Earth is younger than you might think.
                    Understanding how the world works often involves drilling deep below its
                    surface, something we haven’t been able to do until fairly recently. Isaac
                    Newton calculated the movement of the stars hundreds of years before we
                    understood some of the basics of our planet.
                    It was not until the 19th century that scientists agreed that Earth had, on
                    multiple occasions, been covered in ice.¹⁵ There was too much evidence to
                    argue otherwise. All over the world sat fingerprints of a previously frozen
                    world: huge boulders strewn in random locations; rock beds scraped down to
                    thin layers. Evidence became clear that there had not been one ice age, but
                    five distinct ones we could measure.
                    The amount of energy needed to freeze the planet, melt it anew, and freeze it
                    over yet again is staggering. What on Earth (literally) could be causing these
                    cycles? It must be the most powerful force on our planet.
                    And it was. Just not in the way anyone expected.
                    There were plenty of theories about why ice ages occurred. To account for
                    their enormous geological influence the theories were equally grand. The
                    uplifting of mountain ranges, it was thought, may have shifted the Earth’s
                    winds enough to alter the climate. Others favored the idea that ice was the
                    natural state, interrupted by massive volcanic eruptions that warmed us up.
                    But none of these theories could account for the cycle of ice ages. The growth
                    of mountain ranges or some massive volcano may explain one ice age. It
                    could not explain the cyclical repetition of five.

                <p id="chap5"><b>5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy  </b>
                    <pre>
                        There are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so.
                        But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and
                        paranoia.
                        And that’s a topic we don’t discuss enough.
                        Let’s begin with a quick story about two investors, neither of whom knew the
                        other, but whose paths crossed in an interesting way almost a century ago.
                        Jesse Livermore was the greatest stock market trader of his day. Born in
                        1877, he became a professional trader before most people knew you could do
                        such a thing. By age 30 he was worth the inflation-adjusted equivalent of
                        $100 million.
                        By 1929 Jesse Livermore was already one of the most well-known investors
                        in the world. The stock market crash that year that ushered in the Great
                        Depression cemented his legacy in history.
                        More than a third of the stock market’s value was wiped out in an October
                        1929 week whose days were later named Black Monday, Black Tuesday, and
                        Black Thursday.
                        Livermore’s wife Dorothy feared the worst when her husband returned home
                        on October 29th. Reports of Wall Street speculators committing suicide were
                        spreading across New York. She and her children greeted Jesse at the door in
                        tears, while her mother was so distraught she hid in another room, screaming.
                        Jesse, according to biographer Tom Rubython, stood confused for a few
                        moments before realizing what was happening.
                        He then broke the news to his family: In a stroke of genius and luck, he had
                        been short the market, betting stocks would decline.
                        “You mean we are not ruined?” Dorothy asked.
