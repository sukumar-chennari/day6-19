        <pre>
                Let me tell you about a problem. It might make you feel better about what
                        you do with your money, and less judgmental about what other people do
                        with theirs.
                        People do some crazy things with money. But no one is crazy.
                        Here’s the thing: People from different generations, raised by different
                        parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different
                        parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job
                        markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very
                        different lessons.
                        Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And
                        what you’ve experienced is more compelling than what you learn secondhand. So all of us—you, me, everyone—go through life anchored to a set of
                        views about how money works that vary wildly from person to person. What
                        seems crazy to you might make sense to me.
                        The person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk and reward in ways the
                        child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom if he tried.
                        The person who grew up when inflation was high experienced something the
                        person who grew up with stable prices never had to.
                        The stock broker who lost everything during the Great Depression
                        experienced something the tech worker basking in the glory of the late 1990s
                        can’t imagine.
                        The Australian who hasn’t seen a recession in 30 years has experienced
                        something no American ever has.
                        On and on. The list of experiences is endless.
                        You know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life
                        with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one
                        of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve
