        <pre>
                                Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life
                    is guided by forces other than individual effort.
                    NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to
                    remember when judging success—both your own and others’: “Nothing is as
                    good or as bad as it seems.”
                    Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a
                    computer.
                    The story of how Lakeside School, just outside Seattle, even got a computer
                    is remarkable.
                    Bill Dougall was a World War II navy pilot turned high school math and
                    science teacher. “He believed that book study wasn’t enough without realworld experience. He also realized that we’d need to know something about
                    computers when we got to college,” recalled late Microsoft co-founder Paul
                    Allen.
                    In 1968 Dougall petitioned the Lakeside School Mothers’ Club to use the
                    proceeds from its annual rummage sale—about $3,000—to lease a Teletype
                    Model 30 computer hooked up to the General Electric mainframe terminal for
                    computer time-sharing. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in
                    1965,” Gates later said. “Someone was pretty forwardlooking.” Most
                    university graduate schools did not have a computer anywhere near as
                    advanced as Bill Gates had access to in eighth grade. And he couldn’t get
                    enough of it.
                    Gates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul Allen. Allen was
                    also obsessed with the school’s computer, and the two hit it off.
