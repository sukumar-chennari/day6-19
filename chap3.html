            John Bogle, the Vanguard founder who passed away in 2019, once told a
            story about money that highlights something we don’t think about enough:
            At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his
            pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more
            money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel

            about the privileged few who begin life on third base. Gupta couldn’t even
            see the baseball stadium.
            What he went on to achieve from those beginnings was simply phenomenal.
            By his mid 40s Gupta was CEO of McKinsey, the world’s most prestigious
            consulting firm. He retired in 2007 to take on roles with the United Nations
